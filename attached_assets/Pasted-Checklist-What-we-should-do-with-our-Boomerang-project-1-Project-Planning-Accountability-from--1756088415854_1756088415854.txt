Checklist 
 What we should do with our Boomerang project
1. Project Planning & Accountability (from Kelly Winter’s approach)
Create a Gantt chart to map out milestones such as:


Defining app goals


Designing wireframes/UI mockups


Setting up database structure


Developing key functions (reminders, health metric tracking)


Testing and feedback


Final evaluation


Hold regular check-ins with your group (Jemma, Yvonne, Nicole) where each person reports progress.


Assign roles clearly (e.g., developer, researcher, designer).


Celebrate small achievements (completing reminders function, UI mockup, etc.) to keep motivation high.



2. 
Showcasing & Innovation 

Emphasize accessibility features (large text, easy navigation).


Promote curated health data as your unique, trustworthy point of difference.


Consider a wearable integration (Apple Watch/Wear OS) as your “wow” factor.



3. 
Documentation & Reflection
Keep a shared group google doc (include):


What you worked on each week.


Problems faced and how you solved them.


Screenshots of your design/prototype.


This will help when writing your evaluation.



4. 
Development a model
Decide on a methodology:


Agile → Best fit for your project. You can test and adapt features (like medicine reminders) as you go.


Waterfall → Would be too rigid, but you could apply it for the early research/design phase.


Use Design Thinking: Empathize with elderly users - Define their challenges (e.g. remembering pills, navigating apps) - Ideate solutions - Prototype - Test.



5. 
Final Presentation & Collaboration
Be ready to pitch your project


Focus on the problem (elderly struggle with health management).


Show your solution (Boomerang app).


Emphasize benefits (trustworthy, accessible, supportive).
